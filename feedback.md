## Initial Feedback 12/12/2017

- THis app is coming along well 
- I think the main work will come in tidying up the tables and presentations
- I see the scraping is working so far, let me know if you have any problems with further scraping. 



## Feedback on Class Presentation and APP

### What your classmates liked

- would be very useful, clear instructions
-Very useful app.
- Really practical it would definitely be useful to the school
- Very useful and practical for most students to use. 
- This is an incredibly useful app for Brown students (I really wish this existed in my 4 years!)
- This is my group
- The app is applicable and helpful to undergrads at Brown.
- this app seems very useful, i liked all the features you chose to add, the layout was aesthetically - pleasing and seemed very intuitive to use
- The idea is great. And it is gonna be very useful for designing the study and career plan. It helps collect and tidy information from different websites.
- this was mine
- using web scrapping from multiple sites to save student time 
- Functionality and usefulness for a particular group of people(incoming freshman)
- I like the functionality of this app as I personally find it very useful. The app live queries from indeed.com is also a huge plus.
- It is very useful for Brown undergraduate and advisor to plan for their career. The web scrap is very helpful.
- This is my app
- I think it would be useful for undergrads.
- It's a very useful app for students.
- Shows classes based on a concentration
- Very helpful for Brown undergraduates. Good idea.
- It was creative with a lot of information neatly organized.
- This would have been super useful if I was an undergrad, does everything I need.
- Very practical tool for undergraduate students 
- A good tool for advisors undergraduates (and possibly with graduate students too).
"-nice choice of colours
-very useful app
-nice use of concept learnt in class and out of class e.g websrcaping
"
- The usefullness
- It's pretty practical and I think students in university can really make use of it.



### Classmates suggestions for Improvement

- format of text output is not consistent, job board function does not go beyond what is possible on the original job board website
- ui font a bit small and clustered; also general ui
- Explain the premise and functionality of the app
- Include starting salary in jobs table for convenience
- It would look better if there was a way to remove NAs (perhaps make the text " " whenever there was an NA) and putting comparisons side by side rather than up or down would be better. 
- This is my group
- Includes concentration for graduate students, too because undergrads may change major when applying graduate school. Give them some advise and directions.
- Does this app automatically update if a new concentration is created at Brown - this could be a cool feature to consider adding in the future!
- Like they said in the presentation, the audience for this app is mainly undergraduate students and advisor. It would be great if graduate students can also use it for study and career plan. Perhaps, they can also gather information from other external websites, which can give some guide for students in their concentration.
- na
- Data output 
- more visualizations, maybe simpler ones when comparing one major to another
- The comparison table should be put side by side, not one over the other as of now.
- Order the information in the table by relevance or availability. Add more choice when filter the information. Can also add suggestion for graduate students if time permits.
- This is my app
- I think the tables could use a bit of aesthetic work.
- Could have more broad background like for master and PhD student.
- Making the summary tables more organized, they could also use a download option to save the tables
- Very good design.
- N/A
- Not for this project, but if you could display most popluar classes by concencentration? That would be awesome. If you will put it up for students it is possible to collect data too? Most popular concentration, which concentration takes this class the most, etc. 
- I think it's very good
- They should include an instruction tab.  They will need to complete their tabs. While this is a good idea, it is only for Brown students; it would be a good idea to expand that to include more schools. 
- Incorporate graphs
- The packages should auto install. 
- More plots can be put into the app so it will be more beautiful.



### Changes to be made before turning it in

- You will want an instruction tab, possibly with screenshots of the other tabs so the user can know how to use it. 
- I would clean up the tables, if you use something like a tibble, then users can actually search the data [Shiny Data Table](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/datatables.html)
- Make sure the app is functioning for the aspects you have listed so far. 
- Change some fonts to make it more readable
